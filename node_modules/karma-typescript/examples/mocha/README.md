# Runnable example of unit testing Typescript on the fly in Karma with Istanbul coverage and Mocha

To run the example tests, issue the following commands:

```
npm install karma-typescript
cd node_modules/karma-typescript/examples/mocha
npm install
npm test
```

The example unit tests should now run in Karma and html test coverage should be created in the folder `coverage` in the project root.
